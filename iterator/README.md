### What is the Iterator Pattern?

The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a standard way to traverse through a group of objects. It decouples the collection from the way it's traversed, making it more flexible and reusable.

### Benefits:

- **Encapsulation:** Hides the internal structure of the collection.
- **Flexibility:** Supports different traversal algorithms.
- **Reusability:** Can be used with different types of collections.
