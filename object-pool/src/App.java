/**
 * When it is necessary to work with a large number of objects that are particularly expensive to
 * instantiate and each object is only needed for a short period of time, the performance of an
 * entire application may be adversely affected. An object pool design pattern may be deemed
 * desirable in cases such as these.
 *
 * <p>The object pool design pattern creates a set of objects that may be reused. When a new object
 * is needed, it is requested from the pool. If a previously prepared object is available it is
 * returned immediately, avoiding the instantiation cost. If no objects are present in the pool, a
 * new item is created and returned. When the object has been used and is no longer needed, it is
 * returned to the pool, allowing it to be used again in the future without repeating the
 * computationally expensive instantiation process. It is important to note that once an object has
 * been used and returned, existing references will become invalid.
 *
 * <p>In this example we have created {@link OliphauntPool} inheriting from generic {@link
 * ObjectPool}. {@link Oliphaunt}s can be checked out from the pool and later returned to it. The
 * pool tracks created instances and their status (available, inUse).
