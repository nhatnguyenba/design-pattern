### Advantages of the Prototype Pattern

The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a mechanism to create new objects by copying existing
objects, rather than creating them from scratch. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Performance:** Creating objects through cloning can be significantly faster than constructing them from scratch,
  especially for complex objects with many attributes or relationships.
- **Flexibility:** The prototype pattern allows for dynamic changes to the object structure without modifying the
  original class. New object types can be created by cloning and modifying existing prototypes.
- **Reduced class complexity:** By using prototypes, you can avoid creating complex object creation logic within the
  class itself.
- **Easier to understand:** The code becomes more readable and maintainable as the object creation process is
  encapsulated within the prototype.

### Prototype design pattern example

#### Understanding the Challenge

Creating User objects can be expensive due to database queries or network requests. This overhead can significantly
impact application performance, especially in scenarios with high user traffic.

#### Solution

The prototype pattern can be employed to optimize User object creation. We can clone a User object instead of creating
it from scratch. This approach avoids redundant database calls or network requests.
