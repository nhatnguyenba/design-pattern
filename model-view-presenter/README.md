### Understanding MVP

MVP (Model-View-Presenter) is a design pattern that separates the concerns of an application into
three distinct components:

- **Model:** Represents the data layer. It handles data access, manipulation, and persistence.
- **View:** Represents the user interface. It displays data and handles user interactions.
- **Presenter:** Acts as the intermediary between the Model and View. It retrieves data from the
  Model and updates the View accordingly.

### Advantages of Model-View-Presenter (MVP)

- **Clear separation of concerns:** Isolates UI, logic, and data.
- **Improved testability:** Easier to unit test components independently.
- **Enhanced maintainability:** Code becomes more organized and easier to modify.
- **Flexibility:** Facilitates UI changes without affecting core logic.
- **Reusability:** Presenter logic can be reused across different UIs.
- **Better architecture:** Promotes a structured and scalable application design.
