### Intent of Flyweight Design Pattern
The Flyweight design pattern is crucial for optimizing memory usage and enhancing application performance. By
minimizing the number of objects created, it significantly reduces the memory footprint. The primary goal of the
Flyweight pattern is to share as much data as possible among similar objects, thereby improving efficiency and
performance.

### Example of Flyweight Pattern
Alchemist's shop has shelves full of magic potions. Many of the potions are the same so there is no need to create a new
object for each of them. Instead, one object instance can represent multiple shelf items so the memory footprint remains
small.
